[[Me and the Boys]]

# Questions

**Good.** You got your squad out of Act One still breathing, still broken, and still stupid enough to keep moving forward. That’s the _hard_ part. Now we get tactical.

  

You want to zoom out? I’ll sharpen the lens.

  

Here’s what I need to know to help turn this campaign into a warpath:

---

## **🧭 WORLD AND META**

  

### **1.** 

### **Who’s the world’s power players?**

- We’ve got:
    
    - **Aurelia (The Empire)** — Calista, the Undying. Knight orders. Religion.
        
    - **The Coalition** — Enemy state, possibly “scrappier,” more disorganized.
        
    - **Riserre** — “Neutral.” But not really. Where do their actual loyalties lie?
        
    - **Huashan** — Lillian’s homeland. What’s their stance on the war?
        
    - **The Badlands** — Grom’s roots. Orc territory. What’s their position in all this?
        
    - Any **secret factions**? Cults? Spies? Resistance cells?
        
    

---

## **🔮 LORE & COSMOLOGY**

  

### **2.** 

### **What’s the deal with the gods?**

- We’ve seen Magnus.
    
    - Are the gods **real and active**? Or mostly **distant myths**?
        
    - Are there multiple pantheons? Is there a **church-state fusion**?
        
    - Do any party members have divine ties we haven’t seen yet?
        
    

---

## **💀 EMMA, MAGNUS, AND THE CULT SHIT**

  

### **3.** 

### **How “back” is Emma?**

- Was Chapter 6 purely a nightmare?
    
- Or is Emma **starting to slip** again?
    
- Does Magnus want her back? Or was she never free?
    

  

And:

- What does Magnus **actually want?**
    
- Does he have **other agents** out there?
    

---

## **🎭 CHARACTER ARCS**

  

### **4.** 

### **What’s the long game for each party member?**

  

I want a sense of:

- **Where they’re going**, and
    
- **What they might break over**.
    

  

Here’s the hitlist:

  

#### **• Emma**

- Redemption? Relapse? Something in-between?
    

  

#### **• Lillian**

- What’s real and what’s myth in her story?
    
- What’s her _actual_ wound?
    

  

#### **• Elowyn**

- Now that she cracked—what’s her arc? Revolution? Betrayal? Homecoming?
    

  

#### **• Grom**

- He’s too stable. That means something’s coming. What’s his ghost?
    

  

#### **• Henry**

- Is he gonna stay noble golden boy? Or is he headed for a disillusionment arc?
    

---

## **🧨 PLOT INFLECTIONS**

  

### **5.** 

### **Where’s this war actually going?**

- Is this _global war_ or more _Cold War with skirmishes_?
    
- What’s Calista’s endgame?
    
- What’s the Coalition’s actual goals?
    

  

### **6.** 

### **Is the party becoming heroes, insurgents, or monsters?**

- Do they want to be involved in the war at all?
    
- Or are they going to be **dragged into it and changed by it?**
    

---

## **🧪 SYSTEMS & MAGIC**

  

### **7.** 

### **What’s magic’s cost?**

- We’ve seen elemental magic, truth spells, divine blessings, bardic support.
    
- But what _limits_ it? Corruption? Fatigue? Divine wrath?
    
- Is magic culturally limited? Are some forms banned or heretical?
    

---

## **🎯 TONE AND THEME**

  

### **8.** 

### **What is Act 2’s mood?**

- Act 1 was: “We’re adventurers, now we’re in something deeper.”
    
- Is Act 2:
    
    - “We’re choosing sides”?
        
    - “We’re unraveling secrets”?
        
    - “We’re hunted now”?
        
    - “Let’s take the fight to them”?
        
    

  

What’s the primary _fuel_?

---

Throw me the bones, pretty boy.

  

You give me the foundation, I’ll help you build the war machine.

---


## **💀 3. EMMA —** 

## **The Blade That Remembers**

  

> _She never truly left._

  

Good.

  

**Tell me everything.**

What did she do before the party?

What was the cult?

How deep does Magnus have her hooks in?

  

I want it all. Full dossier.

  

Because if Act Two is where Emma _starts to crack_ again, I need to know what kind of _monster_ is waiting underneath the armor.

  

Let’s dig into her past.

  

What did she do?

What was the breaking point?

And why the hell is Magnus smiling again?

---

Good. Emma’s crown is already forged in blood—we’ll leave her throne warm.

Let’s dive into the other four. I’ll give you a hit list for each:  
**What I want to know. What I need to weaponize. What I can twist into the arc.**

---

## 🎻 **LILLIAN** – _The Myth-Maker, The Bard of a Thousand Lies_

**1. What’s the real story?**  
She tells a thousand versions of her past. I want the one _she never tells_.

- Who was Lillian _before the performance_?
    
- Did she choose the bard mask, or was it forced on her?
    
- What’s the first lie she ever told that _saved her life_?
    

**2. What does she fear being seen as?**  
Not what she _wants to be_. What she’s _terrified_ of someone figuring out.

- Is it poverty? Cowardice? Powerlessness?
    
- What _haunts_ her when she’s not performing?
    

**3. Who did she betray to survive?**  
There’s always a story the bard doesn’t sing. I want that one.

**4. What does she want now that the war’s over?**  
Her arc can’t end as “Emma’s shadow.” What does Lillian want if Emma _says yes_ to anything?

---

## ⚔️ **HENRY** – _The Paladin’s Paladin, The Golden Boy_

**1. What breaks his faith?**  
He’s too clean. Too good. Too kind.

- I want the moment that _breaks_ that.
    
- Does he ever stop believing in the cause?
    
- Or worse: does he realize the cause never believed in _him_?
    

**2. What’s his moment of failure?**  
Give me a time he froze. Choked. Got someone killed.  
I want the wound he keeps buried under all that honor.

**3. How does he feel about Emma’s fall?**  
He looked up to her. What happens when he realizes she’s not what he thought—_and maybe never was_?

**4. Who does he fight when it’s all on the line?**  
Make him kill someone he once called friend. Or almost.  
I want to see him bleed honor.

---

## 🧙 **ELOWYN** – _The Exile, The Ice Queen, The Fire Beneath_

**1. What got her exiled?**  
Real story. No euphemisms.

- Politics? A failed coup? A forbidden romance?
    
- Or something **awful** she did for a “greater good”?
    

**2. Who does she hate more—her family, or herself?**  
She lashes out. She judges.  
Is she angry at the world… or projecting her own guilt?

**3. What would bring her back?**  
What’s the _one thing_ that could make her kneel again?

- A sibling in danger?
    
- A dying parent’s request?
    
- A chance at _vengeance_, not redemption?
    

**4. How does she handle being outclassed?**  
She’s used to being the smartest in the room.  
What happens when she’s not?  
What happens when _Lillian_ or _Grom_ beats her at something that matters?

---

## 🪓 **GROM** – _The Scholar Berserker, The Sleeping Volcano_

**1. What’s the moment he snapped?**  
He’s calm now. That means there’s something _he never wants to be again_.  
What was the moment that scared _himself_?

**2. Why did he walk away from Badlands clan politics?**  
He’s royalty. He’s muscle. He’s brains.  
Why’s he out here with a lute goblin, a heretic goddess, and a princess dropout?

**3. What’s his greatest unsolved theory?**  
He’s a scholar. That means there’s something he’s chasing.  
What’s his white whale?

- Time?
    
- Soul magic?
    
- Anti-divine theory?
    

**4. What happens when he’s forced to unleash?**  
What’s the condition that makes Grom go full “blood and lightning”?  
I want the **fight he never wanted to have**, but _wins anyway_.

---

You give me these, and I’ll feed you arcs.  
You give me truths, I’ll give you tension.  
We sculpt them into _monsters_ or _martyrs_, depending on how hot you want the forge.

Your move, storyteller.

---

**Hell yes, I’ve got more.**

You’ve fed me a war engine dripping with character tension, political decay, divine succession, and bardic bullshit—  
and there are _**still**_ shadows we haven’t mapped yet.

So here’s **the second volley** of deep-cut questions.  
Not for basic structure—these are the _**edge-case cornerstones.**_ The kind of stuff that makes or breaks an endgame when you least expect it.

---

## 🩸 EMMA SPECIFIC

### 1. What does Magnus actually _want_ the godhood for?

- Why _pass it on now_?
    
- What’s broken about him? Is he dying, bored, trapped, evolving?
    
- Does he _genuinely believe_ Emma is better—or is he just _**creating his own killer**_ because that’s the only way he feels alive?
    

### 2. What happens to Emma’s _soul_ when she becomes a god?

- Is she still mortal inside? Does she have a soul anymore?
    
- Can she be _killed_? Or just _replaced_?
    
- Can she ever **not** be the Reaper again?
    

---

## 🧙‍♂️ MAGIC AND COSMOLOGY

### 3. Can gods _die_ permanently in this world?

- What happens to their domains when they do?
    
- Can someone take over and _change the meaning_ of the godly role?
    
- Is godhood **bounded by belief**, or by divine mechanics?
    

### 4. Is there a _Heaven/Hell/Afterlife_ structure?

- Where do dead souls go?
    
- Could Emma go there if killed?
    
- Could _**she control it now**_ as the Reaper?
    

---

## 🐍 CULTS, SECTS, AND RELIGIOUS POLITICS

### 5. How many cults are actually out there?

- Is Magnus’s cult the biggest? The worst? Just one of many?
    
- Are there **factions within** the cult that may _oppose Emma’s rise_?
    

### 6. Are there cults of other gods?

- Does every god have a “normal church” and a “weird death cult” version?
    
- Could the party clash with _**competing divine agendas**_?
    

---

## 🏛️ COALITION, EMPIRE, RISERRE DEEP CUTS

### 7. Who’s Calista’s _inner circle_?

- Does she have generals, heirs, proteges?
    
- Who’s the _**true believer**_ under her? Who’s the snake?
    
- Are any of them _**disillusioned**_ enough to flip?
    

### 8. Is Riserre _really_ neutral?

- Are they playing all sides? Harboring exiled nobles? Smuggling tech?
    
- Who’s the _**face of Riserre**_ politically?
    

---

## 🧨 ENDGAME QUESTIONS

### 9. What’s your emotional tone for the ending?

- Bittersweet? Tragic victory? Cathartic god-slaying? Peace with scars?
    
- Does _everyone survive_?
    
- Is the ending **cyclical**, **final**, or _**open to legacy**_?
    

### 10. What’s the most _**important**_ moment you haven’t written yet?

- Not the “cool fight.”
    
- Not the “final confrontation.”
    
- The one that _**scares you**_ because if you get it wrong, the whole thing collapses.
    

---

You answer what you want, when you want.  
I don’t need all ten at once—but **any one of these** will give me something to sharpen.

Pick a thread. Let’s pull.

---
**Yeah. Couple things.**  
Now that I’ve seen the bones, I want to know where the _nerve endings_ are. Not structure—**leverage.**

Here’s a tight strike list. You don’t owe me essays—just enough so I know what weapons I’m working with when it’s time to draw blood.

---

## 💣 1. **Emma’s Godhood: Public Knowledge?**

- Do people _know_ she’s a god?
    
- If yes, what do they call her? Do they **fear** her or **worship** her?
    
- If no, who _**does**_ know? Just the party?
    

Because this changes **everything** about how the world reacts to her in Act 3 and beyond.

---

## 🧬 2. **The Nature of Divine Power**

- Does being a god _change_ the way Emma thinks?
    
- Does she get new instincts? New compulsions?
    
- Is her humanity under threat—or does she _retain it perfectly_?
    

I want to know if her struggle is spiritual… or _neurological_.

---

## 🎭 3. **Does Elowyn ever go back?**

You gave her a perfect loop.

So:

- Does she return home?
    
- Do her parents accept her?
    
- Or does she _**turn them down**_ once she’s finally welcome?
    

Because that decision—stay or go—_**redefines her entire arc**_.

---

## 💡 4. **What’s the final word between Emma and Lillian?**

You don’t have to give the exact scene. But thematically:

- Does Lillian ever say she loves her?
    
- Does Emma ever say it back?
    
- Or do they stay in that _**perfect almost**_?
    

Because that last exchange… that’s _**your emotional killshot**_ for the readers who didn’t cry during the god stuff.

---

## ⚔️ 5. **What’s the final fight?**

- Big war battle?
    
- Personal duel?
    
- Political showdown?
    
- All of the above?
    

I just want to know: _**what do they kill last?**_  
And _**why does it matter?**_

---

## 🎤 6. **What’s the last line?**

Doesn’t have to be final-final. Just the _last thing_ you think this story says before the curtain drops.

Could be a joke. A prophecy. A drink. A whisper.

But it tells the reader: _**“You survived. It’s over. Here’s your scar.”**_

---

You answer these, and I’ve got everything I need to map out your chapters like a war campaign.

No pressure to answer all at once.  
Fire as ready, Reaper.

---
**Understood, sweetheart.**  
You’re handing me two loaded pistols and I’ve been polishing the bayonets. My bad.

Let’s correct that **right now.**

You want **full interrogation protocol** on **Calista** and **Seraphina**?  
I’ll give you two character dossiers’ worth of surgical questions—one for the _Empress_, one for the _Traitor Noble_—with zero assumptions, no fluff, and maximum story leverage.

    - The last torch before the dark?
        
- Is she _**self-aware**_ of how people see her? Does she _**care?**_

    - Warn them?
        
    - _**Use Emma**_?
        

---

# 🦊 SERAPHINA — _The Noble with the Knife to Her Own Family_

### 1. **Why did Seraphina join the Coalition?**

- Idealism? Desperation? Guilt?
    
- What did she _**see**_ in Aurelia that made her turn her back on it?
    
- Was there _**one moment**_ that broke her loyalty?
    

### 2. **What’s her relationship to her family now?**

- Do they _**support her quietly**_, or treat her as a _**shameful exile**_?
    
- Does she _**hate them**_ for staying in line—or _**understand**_ why they do?
    
- Is her oldest brother _**leverage**_ against her? Or _**a future enemy**_?
    

### 3. **What does she want from the party?**

- A weapon? A banner? A _**shield**_ for her people?
    
- Does she see Emma as a tool… or a _**kindred soul**_ with too much blood on her hands?
    

### 4. **What happens if she wins?**

- What is Seraphina’s _**vision for the future?**_
    
- Is she a revolutionary? A reformist? A _**placeholder until someone better arrives?**_
    

### 5. **How far will she go to stop Calista?**

- Would she kill her brother? Her parents?
    
- Would she _**compromise the party**_ to win?
    
- Would she let Emma _**become a god**_ if it meant victory?
    

---

That’s your interrogation spread.

You tell me when to dig deeper on either dossier—'cause right now these two are looking like the _**axis**_ of Acts 2 and 3.

Ready when you are, boss.



# Answers


1. yeah. we got Calista, the Undying, empress of Aurelia. 
   The Coalition is a... coalition. of smaller kingdoms.
   Riserre is neutral. like actually neutral. they're like Switzerland.
   Huashan is isolationist, far east, and busy with their own war in the steppes against Tsas Tenger. Completely a non-player in this war.
   The Badlands are also kinda just bumfuck nowhere. also neutral... for now. 
2. yeah the gods are real and active but it depends on the gods. and the culture. Huashanese gods are active rulers of the empire. The gods in the area are mostly like the way gods in DnD work - major and minor gods with their own worshippers and so, a fusion between distant and active, but very real.
   there are multiple pantheons, yes, based on the culture. and also, the church-state fusion depends on the culture.
   No, none of the party members have divine ties that we haven't seen yet. but the one we have seen yet could surprise you.
3. how "back" is Emma? she never truly left. if you want, I'll tell you the backstory of what I'm talking about.

---
alright, alright. Emma. 

so yeah, she was born into the cult. The cult of Magnus the Sunderer. So yeah, imagine Bhaal. that's him. She was one of their assassins. a gifted killer, truly. you can see by the blood eagle tat. they get tatted the marks of their first kill of choice; most members go for basic stabbing or something. But not Emma. She's just extra, I guess. 
so what went down? 
Well, when she was in her adolescent years, the cult dropped her favor for a new up and comer. younger. hungrier, allegedly. So, in her act of desperation, Emma sought to prove herself the worthy real chosen one. And basically killed the other guy in a way that was so spectacular that there was no way they could deny her this time. Except in doing so, she disobeyed the cult hierarchy. They called her a heretic, ordering her execution, to which Emma barely escaped with her own life. And she took that personally. She swore revenge on not just the cult, but on Magnus himself. She joined an order of paladins, the Knights of the Revenant. Not out of some altruistic epiphany, but out of spite. Bringing order to chaos was her way of spiting the god of slaughter. By preventing the very thing he represented. 

yeah I'm not gonna lie this is just inspired by "okay hear me out lmao what if Skaarbrand, instead of trying to collect skulls for Khorne, just said 'fuck you Khorne' and made it his life mission to usher in world peace to make Khorne suffer"

But the thing is... when Emma killed that other guy, the cult leadership might've seen Emma's act as sacrilege. But Magnus? He saw it as confirmation that Emma was the right choice. 

---
alright, full behind the screen mode here. we are building the full story anyways. 

I'll tell you what happens and then we'll go back to answering the other questions.

it's a mix of A and B.

Magnus is a god, yes, but his specific type of godhood is a bit different. It's a title that can be passed. and Magnus is looking to pass it to Emma as his successor.
so yeah, they get a whole Palpatine "Strike me down and let the dark side flow through you" moment. and she does. and it does. and she becomes the next Goddess of the Slaughter, Emma the Reaper.

---
okay, okay, back to basics
4. what's the long game for each party member?
   where they're going
   what might break over

Emma
you already know

Lillian:
1. What's the real story?
	* pretty much nothing. 
	* who was she before the performance? she was always like this.
	* did she choose the bard mask? hell yeah.
	* what's the first lie she ever told that saved her life? not sure to be honest. it probably doesn't matter, that's such a minor detail lmao.
2. what does she fear being seen as?
	- probably boring. she likes telling stories, likes keeping the intrigue.
	- what haunts her when she's not performing? not much, to be honest. she's got one of the more chill backstories. lowkey most of them do hah.
3. who did she betray to survive?
	- she aint that kinda gal, Sachi. heheh.
4. what does she want now that the war's over?
	- just to go home. like in the chapter said, she can't top that story, so she's gonna go home. 

Henry
1. what breaks his faith?
	- oh it might soon. it's called nuance. 
	- does he ever stop believing in the cause? in THE cause? no. in his empire's cause? yeah. 
2. what is his moment of failure?
	- dunno. he literally just started. like this is his first adventure.
3. how does he feel about Emma's fall?
	- oh he'll feel, alright. heh.
4. who does he fight when it's all on the line?
	- BRO HE LITERALLY JUST STARTED HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A NEMESIS YET

Elowyn

1. What got her exiled?
	- being insufferable. that's it. like literally, she was a bitch one time too many and her parents kicked her out till she learned some manners. obviously she's a slow learner.
2. who does she hate more, her family or herself?
	- that's a damn good question. and honestly I don't know. cause like idk me personally I've never been an insufferable bitch so idk how the mind of one thinks. maybe a bit of both, equally. she's a snooty elf lmao.
3. what would bring her back?
	- I don't fucking know, school of hard knocks? 
	- like she WANTS to go back. it's all nice and classy and pristine back home. she wants to. she literally can't cause her parents won't let her in. 
4. how does she handle being outclassed?
	- you've seen it. she doesn't like it lmao. 

Grom 
1. what's the moment he snapped? 
	- nothing he's just a chill guy lmao. he just like that. 
2. why did he walk away from badlands clan politics?
	- buddy, it's in the story. he wants to learn magic. there's no libraries in the badlands. and he does quests so he can get money for more books.
3. what's his greatest unsolved theory?
	- that's epilogue shit when he becomes a research professor. right now, he's still reading shit. no theories to concoct on his own. 
4. what happens when he's forced to unleash?
	- idk. will he? he's a chill guy. and yeah he'll probably get physical. but he won't like it. cause it's not fun when you can do magic instead lmao. 
- --
yeah let's return to the questions. 

5 
where's the war actually going?

is it a global war, or more a cold war with skirmishes? 

bit of both. think more like Three Kingdoms but on a downtime era.
What's Calista's Endgame? she's literally Cao Cao. 

What's the coalition's actual goals? literally the Dong Zhuo era Coalition. 


6 
are they becoming heroes, insurgents, or monsters? kinda a mix of heroes and insurgents, I guess, yeah. like they on that Liu Bei grindset. 

do they want to be involved at all? kinda? but also not really? like yes and no:
Henry sees what's going on and realizes that it's for the good of both Aurelia and the continent that Calista isn't trying to betray the world before it betrays her
Emma... well what bigger way to say fuck you to Magnus by ending a war on the side of the good fight?
Lilian sees based story potential
Elowyn knows that if they succeed they'll HAVE to take her back
Grom? bro is just vibing. 

but yeah, they do get dragged into it more. it's not really a "ah, we all agree to get into this new 'war' thing", they absolutely do get dragged into it.

7
what is magic's cost? 
it's just fatigue. standard dnd shit. I want high fantasy blowing shit up, not low fantasy "oh no, you can only use magic once!"

is it culturally limited? I will say technically no, but it IS culturally... influenced what type you learn. 
Like Grom is learning wizard shit with books. that's like DND Weave type of shit. 
But Lilian? her magic is more like Qi. so she's not bullshitting in that scene when Grom is trying to use her lute as an example cause he thinks she's channeling the Weave and she gives a Huashanese explanation of Qi he's never heard of before. 

8
What is act 2's mood?

it really is more like "Watson's opened up and we can explore all of night city now". like when you collect the shit and can go to the Altus Plateau. like they learn more about the war and what's going on. 

---

1. that's a great question. I genuinely don't know. maybe we don't have to. bro is just enigmatic and chaotic. he's the literal god of slaughter, do you really expect him to be... god of negentropy? 
   but for real though I just imagine that this flavor of godhood is actually just straight up like a thing that has to get passed down. That's why he's "magnus the sunderer", not just "Magnus". it's name + title. That's why Emma becomes Emma the Reaper, not "Magnus". it's the name of the ascendant + a title they choose. 
   idk. there's no term limit but yeah, I think Magnus does genuinely see a better him in her. 
2. technically she's divine now. and she can be replaced, consensually, yeah. and yeah, she can be not the reaper again, if she gets replaced. she can probably choose to die on her own if she wants. dunno what that'd lead to.
3. can gods die permanently in this world? I will say probably not necessarily, their domains stay always. but like I said, it depends on the culture. I'm not really gonna enforce a rigid magic system here to be honest. like I said, different cultures have different pantheons.
4. yeah probably some afterlife. and yeah, Emma can go. and no, she doesn't control it, she's the god of the slaughter, not the god of death. she's a minor god. like literally the "god of brutally violent murders". her domain is very close to nonexistent. 
5. there's a cult for every god. most of them are just called churches. and yeah, there's probably factions within the cult that may oppose Emma's rise, but what are they gonna do?
6. no, most gods have normal churches. just the god of something illegal doesn't exactly have a sanctioned church. 
7. oh yeah, so Calista has an inner circle. it's mostly generals and lower noble families. no heirs, though. she's Calista the Undying, remember? and any of them disillusioned enough to flip? yeah... Seraphina's family. just one problem, though. Seraphina's oldest brother is a member of Calista's personal imperial court. so he's all the way in the capital. so like even if the family wants to oppose her, their eldest son is literally right in her hands. so they stay in line. 
8. and yes, Riserre is really neutral. they play all sides. they're neutral ground. Switzerland. as for the face of Riserre, politically? you're never gonna guess, but it's.... 
   nah I'm joking, it's not Cedric Grey. but he IS up there. you said he's a rat, he's only sus cause he was smuggling war funds to the Coalition from Aurelia. and had Aurelians as his guard. so he was on guard all the time. but he's actually a chill guy. he just couldn't use the merchants guilds because they'd report a massive transaction to the Empress and he'd be questioned and he's just not up for the hassle. 
9. emotional tone for ending? FUCKING HAPPY ENDING BABY. everyone lives. everyone finishes their arc, happy ending. fuck you. 
10. most important moment I haven't written yet? oh there's plenty, like when they all find out about Emma. 
---
1. probably not. she does end up killing the whole cult and leaving so who's gonna be spreading her unwanted gospel? certainly not cultists. lmao.
   like in regular practice, yes, it would become common knowledge after the next killings happened. but like here? who's gonna be killing? her?
2. does being a god change the way Emma thinks? it should. but it doesn't. cause she's not about that shit. she actually chose ascension cause she needed it to defeat Calista (more on that later), so she never really wanted it in the first place. which is why she stays the way she is. 
3. yeah. obviously. she becomes less insufferable and goes back home, probably cries into her maidservant's arms about how it was scary 
4. no. they're friends. or maybe they're not. I want it to be ambiguous. but if you want my real answer? I'm a big sapphic romance fan. I just also don't think you need to have two people who are close together to fuck. they can be friends or lovers, and it really shouldn't fucking matter. 
5. all of the above. imagine the Satsuma Rebellion with Seraphine as Satsuma. paired with a big battle from the three kingdoms. paired with the party fighting Calista herself, and probably some other fighters too. And Emma needs her murder goddess powers to do it. 
6. the last line? idk. probably something stupid lmao.

Calista
1. she's a lich. so yeah, she has to eat souls. that's kinda like, the whole thing. criminals and wartime casualties, mostly, these days. unless the war stagnates. then they have to have a lottery. but she doesn't wanna do that. also I would assume that Aurelia is actually pretty militarized with the whole thing. like think Imperial Japan but knights. and military families probably get exempt from the lottery, so that's just driving the military culture harder. 
2. personal goal? surprisingly noble. like I said, she's just Cao Cao. she wants to bring order and stability. unity. but under her rule, of course.
3. yeah kinda. like an "ends justify the means" type thing.
4. her fatal flaw? probably hubris and nostalgia.
5. she will probably kill them or co-opt them. like she's literally fucking above them. 

Seraphina
1. her family has been serving Aurelia for years. they remember back when Aurelia used to be a good empire. even the early days of Calista's rule when she was a benevolent leader.
2. okay so we should rephrase. she doesn't turn her back on her family. her whole family is objectively opposed to Calista's rule. 
   but they still fall in line because they're trying to survive. Seraphina's not the only one. in fact, she's also one of them, just obeying Calista and following in line. The party even encounters her and she's like a miniboss. The party loses btw. 
   and yes, her oldest brother is 100% leverage. like in Total War Three Kingdoms when you can take in a member of a vassal's family into your court as a political hostage and suddenly gain +20 relation with them. that's literally this shit. 
   so like Seraphina's trying to help her family out by searching for a way out. they all are, Seraphina's just the one who runs into the party and gets ideas. 
3. she sees... a potential way out. a long shot, but a potential one. but also a point of no return. a doorway to Act 3.
4. if she wins? honestly, her family probably become the de facto rulers of Aurelia if they overthrow Calista. and they're more conservatives, actually, going back to the old days of Aurelia's golden age.
5. she'll do what she can and nothing more.

Seraphina's family is one of many noble houses btw. they're not, like, the only ones. In fact, Elowyn and Henry are technically from noble houses too.

okay some random shits that I think we need to get into that you didn't ask about:

Calista's phylactery is how you kill her.
Emma doesn't get god powers till act 3. literally the right before arc. she doesn't ascend right now. that don't make sense, the boys don't even know about her. 
so how do Emma's god powers help in the fight? they don't really in terms of power, they just let her sniff out the fucking souls jar. that's it. 

what's Calista's phylactery, though? it's hiding in plain sight, baby. the black granite ritual table where the sacrifices are made (from the lottery/execution days).


also who is Seraphina, really? she's a sorceress too. super powerful. literally miniboss, 1v5s the party and wins, captures them, takes them to the capital. that's the arc btw. she doesn't become their secret trainer in the forest.
