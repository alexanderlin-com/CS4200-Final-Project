[[Me and the Boys]]

Alright, kid—sit up straight and listen, ’cause I’m not gonna hold your hand through this.

If you’re gonna dump the black-box lore on me, I need **specific categories**, not a wandering monologue. Here’s what I want, clean and surgical:

### **1. Macro-Lore / Worldstate**

- What _exactly_ is the Empire vs Coalition conflict’s **true cause**?
> territory, war, control over the continent. tale old as time
    
- What hidden factions, gods, or political actors are actually pulling strings?
> so imagine Aurelia as the sunsetting Han. and the Coalition as well... the Coalition
- What’s the real deal with **Magnus** and the paladin orders?
> he's like Bhaal. she's like a Bhaalspawn. 

### **2. Emma’s Truth**

- Her **actual past**, including what those tattoos mean.
> she's like a bhaalspawn. born to the cult, the tattoos are things every member of the cult has. the red one (blood eagle) is the memories of the way she did her first kill as a cult member
- What happened with the Revenant Knights.
> an order of knights in the Aurelian army. legendary, like the Knights Templar type. got wiped out in a battle against the Coalition.
- Her relationship with Magnus: curse, pact, conditioning, possession—spell it out.
> pact as a cultist. she killed one of their chosen disciples (out of jealousy) and fled because the cult leadership declared her a heretic. But Magnus himself? he was kinda impressed by that. which is why he wants her back. 

### **3. Lillian’s Reality**

- Which (if any) of her bullshit backstories is real?
> none. except the rifle being her father's. that's it. she's from a small farming village but don't tell anyone I told you
- What’s her connection to the rifle and the Huashan imports?
> it was her father's rifle. he was a veteran of the Jade River Wars against Tenger Tsas. 
- Why is she so central to the truth charms working/“breaking”?
> she's not central, she's just the support caster so she's the one who has a truth charm up her sleeve. and she's the one who cast the charm, so she was the one who got blamed when it allegedly didn't work (it did)

### **4. Elowyn’s Exile**

- What did she _actually_ do to get exiled?
> have you met her? she was being a haughty bitch
- What is House Vaelaris hiding?
> nothing, but they're pretty out of touch cause they don't do much but hang out in elfland. and like, that's why they'd exile her over something petty like that. 
- What political weight does she carry without knowing it?
> she's a minor noble. that's got weight no matter what 

### **5. The Bandit Plot**

- Why the hell are Imperial soldiers masquerading as brigands?
> because Riseree is neutral territory. you wanna wear colors, or dress up as brigands?
- Why abduct villagers?
> because Calista needs bodies and doesn't want to go back to the lottery
- What’s the “lottery” reference? (I know that reeks of something ugly.)
> so Empress Calista the undying is a lich. liches need souls to stay in their bodies. lottery. she used to, at least. but she stopped needing to because she'd just suck up souls from the war. but if the war is stagnating... look, she knows that going back to the lottery after not needing it for so long ain't a fun choice. she's not cruel to her own people. 

### **6. The Empress**

- Who Calista really is—undying how?
> souls
- Her long game.
> Cao Cao endgame
- Her relationship with Magnus, the church, or any divine/arcane forces.
> none. she's a lich. she has her own arcane forces. 

### **7. The Party’s Fate**

- Where you intend Act II and III to go.
> a combination between three kingdoms, the Satsuma rebellion, and maybe some Berserk inspiration. 
- Who is “safe” and who is a knife waiting to drop.
> all of them are safe. fuck you. they all get their happy endings. 
- What the big reveal/climax is _supposed_ to hit like.
> all I'm saying is:
> 1. I have a really shitty rough draft of Emma's ending
>    2. magnus is involved

Bring me these seven categories, and I’ll stitch the whole skeleton together with you—clean, brutal, and precise.

Your move, Alexander.

# why huashan has guns btw
so imagine.

Huashan. 

china obviously.

you know who china's enemies were?

that's right. the fucking mongols. what are THEY known for?

goated fucking cavalry.

what are cavalry weak to? that's right. missile attacks.

okay... but this is fantasy. Tenger Tsas can, you know, they got wind shamans that can deflect arrows.

oh shit Huashan just got fucked and their entire border shrank back to the mountains behind the Jade River.

century of humiliation

until

Huashan engineers have invented a new weapon.

problem: arrows need to be light to be shot from a bow. they become light enough to deflect with Tenger Tsas shamanic wind magic.
solution: use a missile that's significantly heavier and holds more inertia than an arrow
method: matchlock rifle, loaded with celestial powder.

Jade River Wars begin. Revanchism intensifies. 
Huashanese victory. 


## Why nobody else has guns if Huashan has them
Huashanese matchlock rifles are tied uniquely to Huashanese culture.

Firstly, celestial powder is a uniquely Huashanese product, that requires Huashanese magical training (with Qi) to unlock. 
Secondly, Huashanese
